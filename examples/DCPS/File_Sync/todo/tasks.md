## Implementation Notes

1. **Incremental Testing**: Each phase should have working functionality that can be demonstrated and tested independently.

2. **Backward Compatibility**: Later phases should not break functionality from earlier phases.

3. **Modular Design**: Each component should be independently testable and replaceable.

4. **Error Handling**: Every phase should include appropriate error handling for its scope.

5. **Documentation**: Each phase should include documentation updates for new functionality.

6. **Performance**: Performance considerations should be addressed incrementally, not left to the end.

This incremental approach ensures that we always have a working system while building toward full functionality, making it easier to identify and fix issues early in the development process.
